ShootHoop

Shoot Hoop is an Android Unity VR basketball style game with 5 backboards based on a project from the Udemy VR Course.  The Player can shoot baskets at 5 different targets.  The course setup the game in Desktop and then added Oculus functionality.  I added functionality to GoogleVR 1.5 on Unity 5.6.

Minimum Android version is 5.1
